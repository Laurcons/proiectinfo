# About Project

This is just a thing I had to do as homework. I had to make a web application, that connects to a MySQL server, and enables you to create a database called `genealogie[Name]` (genealogy) with a table called `rude[Name]` (relatives) with a specific set of columns. The app is supposed to let you insert entries, and must display a certain set of queries executed on that table.

What I did special about this is go over-the-top and write the visual part in React (the back-end is PHP because it was in the project requirements), just to have an excuse to write something in React. It was fun!

## Specifications

The PHP is located in the php/ folder. Place its contents into the root of an Apache htdocs folder. Change the credentials in `pdo.php` to suit your MySQL installation. Make sure to change the URLs in the React .js files to direct to the URL of your Apache htdocs folder (I really don't know how to explain this), you're looking only for calls of the `fetchPost` function. Now you can run the React app (see below) and test the project (if i haven't overseen anything).

This thing is really not that interesting but thanks for checking in!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
